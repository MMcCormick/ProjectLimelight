<p>Hi<%= @user.first_name ? " #{@user.first_name}" : "" %>,</p>

<p>
  I'm Matt, and I'm a Co-Founder of Limelight.
  You're one of our first users, so I wanted to send you an email and see how your first time on Limelight was.
</p>

<p>
  Marc and I built Limelight as a new way to follow the topics you care about, and we want it to be as useful as possible!
  So if you have any ideas on how we can improve it, please don't hesitate to reach out anytime.
  This is my personal email, and it's the quickest way to give me feedback (or get me to fix a bug!).
  In fact, if you could answer some quick questions, it'd be a huge help as we improve the site (please be brutally honest):
</p>

<p>
  1. Do you understand how to use Limelight? What doesn't make sense about the site?
</p>

<p>
  2. Is it clear how Limelight is different from current major social networks?
</p>

<p>
  3. Would you invite a friend to Limelight? If not, why not?
</p>

<p>
  Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!
</p>
