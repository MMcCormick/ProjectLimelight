<p>Hi<%= @user.first_name ? " #{@user.first_name}" : "" %>,</p>

<p>
  I am one of the Co-Founders of Limelight and I noticed you signed up for Limelight <%= @today_or_yesterday %>. Welcome!
</p>

<p>
  I want to thank you for trying Limelight and get your initial impressions. Matt and I created Limelight to make it easier for people to follow things that interest them. We just launched (you're one of our first users!) and would greatly appreciate any feedback you have - ideas, problems, bugs, etc - we want it all!
  In fact, if you could answer a few questions, it'd be really helpful as we improve the site:
</p>

<p>
  1. Do you understand how to use Limelight? What doesn't make sense about the site?
</p>

<p>
  2. Is it clear how Limelight is different from current major social networks?
</p>

<p>
  3. Would you invite a friend to Limelight? If not, why not?
</p>

<p>
  This is my personal email address, so feel free to send suggestions my way, or just say hi.
</p>
